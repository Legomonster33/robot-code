Forms use Blueprint's Input Groups, Form Groups, and Tooltips.

When using an Input Group with a Form Group, set `style={{ width: "auto" }}` on the Input Group.
When using an Input Group with a Form Group and a Tooltip, set `style={{ width: "auto" }}` on the Form Group.

Also remember to link Form Groups and Input Groups together by setting Form Group's `labelFor` and Input Group's `id` to the same value.
