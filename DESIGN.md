### Design
# onshape.py
The script works as follows.
Invoking `onshape pull` pulls code from the document specified in `cfg`.
The project supports multiple documents. Document code is pulled into a `local_code` folder.

By default, `onshape pull` pulls the default document. Other documents may be specified as necessary.
Operations work on `local_code`.

It is an error to push code without pulling first. In such a case, all of the remote documents shall be overwritten. It is up to the user to catch this if this happens.

All operations work on `.fs_code`.

## Example
`onshape pull` - `.fs_code` and `.storage` are pulled from Onshape.
`onshape update --version` - Each file in `.fs_code` is updated to the latest version of the `std`.
`onshape build` - Each file in `fs_gen` is *imported*, executed, and scanned for studio objects. Each studio object is invoked with the appropriate `Path` and `std` version.
    `pull` is not required to be run before `build`.
`onshape push` - Each file in `.fs_code` which was modified is sent to Onshape.



# TODOs:
Add `make_annotation` method to `Enum`?

Readd `__rstr__` for `expr`? Start taking `object`?
